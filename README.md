GeneralAI-Revamped
==================
GeneralAI-Revamped is an Awesomenauts AI designed by the modding community. It
is targeted at fixing the "one-size-fits-all" problem with current GeneralAIs,
where every bot will play the same. GeneralAI-Revamped will introduce diversity
into AI playstyles and fix some more subtle issues with how they play.

How it Works
------------
GeneralAI-Revamped should work by classifying every 'Naut as it is in the game.
For instance, Lonestar is a "fighter" and a "pusher." These "affinities" should
determine each bot's playstyle independently of what 'Naut they play as. For
instance, instead of saying that Clunk and Derpl should tower dive to initiate,
GeneralAI-Revamped should dictate that nukers tower dive to initiate.

Ideally, this project will take advantage of logic already in the [BotCollab
Toolkit](https://github.com/dillmo/Bot-Collab-Toolkits), which has put a lot of
work towards allowing bots to communicate with each other.

If any other contributors have ideas for improving this, please don't hesitate
to add them to this README.
